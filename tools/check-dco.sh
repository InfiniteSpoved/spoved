# Fails when a commit of a pull request lacks a Signed-off-by line (see
# CONTRIBUTING.md). Checks the commits of HEAD that are not in the base
# branch, merge commits excluded, so a merge of develop into the branch
# never counts.
#
# Usage: tools/check-dco.sh [BASE_REF]   (default origin/develop)
#
# Until the go-public date is set in DCO_START (an ISO date, e.g. 2026-11-01),
# the check only reports and exits 0. Once set, commits made before that date
# are ignored and the rest must be signed off. The environment can override it.
